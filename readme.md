Palindrome Check: ✔️
Write a function to determine whether a given string is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

FizzBuzz: ✔️
Print the numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

Two Sum: ✔️
Given an array of integers, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Factorial: ✔️
Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer.

Reverse String: ✔️
Write a function to reverse a given string without using any built-in string reversal functions.

Binary Search: ✔️
Implement the binary search algorithm to find the index of a target element in a sorted array.

Maximum Subarray Sum: 
Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum and return the sum.

Fibonacci Sequence: ✔️
Write a function to generate the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion or dynamic programming.

Anagram Check:
Write a function to check if two strings are anagrams of each other (contain the same characters in a different order).

Merge Sorted Arrays: ✔️
Given two sorted arrays, merge them into a single sorted array.

Longest Common Substring:
Find the longest common substring between two given strings.

Matrix Rotation:
Rotate a given square matrix by 90 degrees in clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

Counting Sort:
Implement the counting sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

Find Duplicates: ✔️
Given an array of integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), find all the duplicates.

String Compression:
Implement a function to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters.
